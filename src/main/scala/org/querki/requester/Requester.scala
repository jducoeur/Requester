   * The central flatMap() operation, which as in any Monad is key to composing these
   * things together.
   * 
   * flatMap() is a bit tricky. The problem we have is that we need to return a RequestM
   * *synchronously* from flatMap, so that higher-level code can compose on it. But
   * the *real* RequestM being returned from handler won't come into existence until
   * some indefinite time in the future. So we need to create a new one right now,
   * and when the real one comes into existence, link its success to that of the one
   * we're returning here.
   * 
   * The initial version of this was beautiful, elegant, and caused stack overflows if
   * you nested flatMaps more than a couple thousand levels deep. (Which, yes, we occasionally do at
   * Querki.) The issue comes during "unwinding" time, when the innermost RequestM finally gets
   * set to a value. The original version had it then call resolve() on the one that contained it,
   * which called resolve() on its parent, and so on, until we finally blew the stack.
   * 
   * So instead, flatMap builds an ugly but practical linked list of RequestM's, with each one
   * essentially pointing to the one above it. We still call resolve() at each level, but those
   * are *not* recursive; instead, we walk up the flatMap chain *tail*-recursively, resolving each node
   * along the way. It's a bit less elegant, but doesn't cause the JVM to have conniptions.

/**
 * Easy and relatively safe variant of "ask".
 * 
 * The idea here is that it would be lovely to have a replacement for the "ask" pattern. Ask
 * is powerful, but quite dangerous -- in particular, handling the response in the most obvious
 * way, using the Future's completion callbacks, is a fine way to break your Actor's threading
 * and cause strange timing bugs.
 * 
 * So the idea here is to build something with similar semantics to ask, but deliberately a bit
 * dumbed-down and safer for routine use. Where ask returns a Future that you can then put 
 * callbacks on, request() takes those callbacks as parameters, and runs them *in this Actor's main thread*.
 * 
 * In other words, I want to be able to say something like:
 * 
 * def receive = {
 *   ...
 *   case MyMessage(a, b) => {
 *     otherActor.request(MyRequest(b)).foreach {
 *       case OtherResponse(c) => ...
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * While OtherResponse is lexically part of MyRequest, it actually *runs* during receive, just like
 * any other incoming message, so it isn't prone to the threading problems that ask is.
 * 
 * How does this work? Under the hood, it actually does use ask, but in a very specific and constrained
 * way. We send the message off using ask, and then hook the resulting Future. When the Future completes,
 * we wrap the response and the handler together in a RequestedResponse message, and loop that back
 * around as a message to the local Actor. 
 * 
 * Note that the original sender is preserved, so the callback can use it without problems. (This is the
 * most common error made when using ask, and was one of the motivations for creating Requester.) 
 * 
 * Note that, to make this work, the Request trait mixes in its own version of unhandled(). For this to
 * work properly, therefore, it is very important that, if your own Actor overrides unhandled, it calls
 * super.unhandled() for unknown messages!
 * 
 * That unhandled() override is usually enough to catch the looped-back messages, so you usually just
 * need to mix Requester into your Actor. However, if your Actor's receive function is intercepting *all*
 * messages (so nothing makes it to unhandled), then you will need to call handleRequestResponse at the
 * beginning of your receive; otherwise, your Actor can wind up deadlocked. This can particularly happen
 * when using stash() during Actor startup:
 * {{{
 * def receive = handleRequestResponse orElse {
 *   case Start => {
 *     persistence.request(LoadMe(myId)) foreach { myState =>
 *       setState(myState)
 *       unstashAll()
 *       become(mainReceive)
 *     }
 *   }
 *   
 *   case _ => stash()
 * }
 * }}}
 * In this startup pattern, we are stashing all messages until the persister responds with the Actor's state.
 * However, if we didn't have handleRequestResponse there, the response would also get stashed, so the
 * Actor would never receive the state message, and the Actor would be stuck.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Requester is *not* compatible with stateful versions of become() -- that is, if you are
 * using become() in a method where you are capturing the parameters in the closure of become(),
 * Requester will probably not work right. This is because the body of the response handler will capture
 * the closed-over parameter, and if the Actor has become() something else in the meantime, the handler
 * will use the *old* data, not the new.
 * 
 * More generally, Requester should be used with caution if your Actor changes state frequently.
 * While it *can* theoretically be used with FSM, it may not be wise to do so, since the state machine
 * may no longer be in a compatible state by the time the response is received. Requester is mainly intended
 * for Actors that spend most or all of their time in a single state; it generally works quite well for those.
